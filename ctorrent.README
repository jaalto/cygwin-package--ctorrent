ctorrent
------------------------------------------

BitTorrent client written in C++

This application is written in the C++ language and doesn't require
any graphical component, such as an X server. Original ctorrent's
upstream has stopped its development and now it's kept updated with
new releases/bug fixes by a new developer. It's built as a console
program and it can be even used remotely in a machine that provides
outside ssh access.
